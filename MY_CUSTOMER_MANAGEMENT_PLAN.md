Customers 
Customers would be of two types i.e 

Industries & Restaurents (B2B)
•	To industries & restaurants, we usually sell gas on credit and doesn’t charge security for the cylinder.
•	So I would like to have a record of Payment & cylinders due with this type of customer.
•	Also sometimes there is some gas is remaining in the cylinders when they are returning empty i.e 5kg or 10kg, customers wants us to buy back that gas from them, we then buy back those gas from them on 60% (40% less the price for which it was sold to them). So the software shall be able to do this calculation as well, subtracting the amount of money of the gas returned on -40% calculation, subtracting this amount from the total ledger amount. 
•	Also we sell regulators to these customers & other essentials as well
