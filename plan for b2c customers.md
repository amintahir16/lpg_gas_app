Homes (B2C)
With home we do not do any credit, also we charge security for the cylinder as well. But I shall be having track or record of the cylinder that are there with them even If they paid security for it, so that I know that how many cylinders I have bought and how many are distributed in the market. Also I sell essential stop these customers as well but I donâ€™t buy back the gas from them

Address, Name & Contact Recording System
There should be a system to record each customers number along with their name & address, so that next time that he or she orders, I would know where to deliver it
