# Vendors API Fix - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!**

Successfully fixed the vendors API by correcting the database field references and relations, resolving the "Unknown field" errors.

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **🔧 Database Field Corrections**
Fixed incorrect field references in the vendors API:

1. **`purchases` → `purchase_entries`**: Updated include statement to use correct relation name
2. **`totalAmount` → `totalPrice`**: Updated to use correct field name from PurchaseEntry model
3. **Removed Invalid Relations**: Removed `payments` from purchase_entries (doesn't exist)
4. **Simplified Calculations**: Streamlined payment calculations to use direct vendor payments

### **📊 API Query Structure**
Updated vendors API to use correct Prisma schema:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
purchases: {
  select: {
    totalAmount: true,      // ❌ Field doesn't exist
    paidAmount: true,       // ❌ Field doesn't exist
    balanceAmount: true,    // ❌ Field doesn't exist
    payments: { ... }       // ❌ Relation doesn't exist
  }
}

// After (FIXED)
purchase_entries: {
  select: {
    totalPrice: true,       // ✅ Correct field
    status: true            // ✅ Valid field
  }
}
```
