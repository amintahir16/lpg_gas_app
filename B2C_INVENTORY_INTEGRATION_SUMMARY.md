# B2C Inventory Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full inventory integration for B2C customer transactions. B2C transactions now properly deduct cylinders and accessories from inventory in real-time, matching the functionality already present in B2B transactions.

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `src/app/api/customers/b2c/transactions/route.ts`

#### 1. Added CylinderType Import
```typescript
import { CylinderType } from '@prisma/client';
```

#### 2. Implemented Cylinder Inventory Deduction (Lines 231-274)
When a B2C customer purchases a cylinder and pays security:
- ✅ Finds available FULL cylinders of the requested type from inventory
- ✅ Validates sufficient inventory is available (throws error if insufficient)
- ✅ Updates cylinder status from 'FULL' to 'WITH_CUSTOMER'
- ✅ Sets cylinder location to track it's with a B2C customer
- ✅ Logs the deduction with `[B2C]` prefix for tracking

**Example Flow:**
```
Customer purchases 2x Domestic (11.8kg) cylinders
→ System finds 2 FULL Domestic cylinders in inventory
→ Updates their status to WITH_CUSTOMER
→ Associates them with the B2C customer
→ Transaction completes
```

#### 3. Implemented Cylinder Return to Inventory (Lines 276-347)
When a B2C customer returns cylinders:
- ✅ Finds cylinders that are WITH_CUSTOMER and associated with B2C customers
- ✅ Updates their status to 'EMPTY'
- ✅ Changes location to 'Store - Ready for Refill'
- ✅ If not enough cylinders found with customer, creates new empty cylinders
- ✅ Properly applies 25% deduction on security returns
- ✅ Logs the return with `[B2C]` prefix

**Example Flow:**
```
Customer returns 1x Standard (15kg) cylinder
→ System finds cylinder WITH_CUSTOMER status
→ Updates status to EMPTY
→ Moves to 'Store - Ready for Refill'
→ Customer gets 75% of security back (25% deduction)
```

#### 4. Implemented Accessory Inventory Deduction (Lines 349-461)
When a B2C customer purchases accessories:

**Stoves:**
- ✅ Extracts quality (A, B, C) from item name
- ✅ Finds matching stove in inventory
- ✅ Validates sufficient quantity
- ✅ Decrements stove quantity and totalCost
- ✅ Logs with quality level

**Regulators:**
- ✅ Finds regulator in inventory
- ✅ Validates sufficient quantity
- ✅ Decrements regulator quantity and totalCost
- ✅ Handles all regulator types

**Gas Pipes:**
- ✅ Finds gas pipe in inventory
- ✅ Validates sufficient quantity
- ✅ Decrements pipe quantity
- ✅ Works for "pipe" and "hose" keywords

**Other Accessories:**
- ✅ Searches Product table by name (case-insensitive)
- ✅ Validates sufficient stockQuantity
- ✅ Decrements product stockQuantity
- ✅ Handles any other accessory type

**Example Flows:**
```
Customer purchases 1x Stove - A quality
→ System finds Stove with quality 'A'
→ Decrements quantity by 1
→ Updates totalCost accordingly
→ Transaction completes

Customer purchases 2x Regulators
→ System finds Regulator in inventory
→ Validates 2 available
→ Decrements quantity by 2
→ Updates totalCost
→ Transaction completes
```

## Real-Time Updates

All inventory updates happen within a **Prisma database transaction** (`prisma.$transaction`), ensuring:
- ✅ **Atomicity**: All updates succeed or all fail (no partial updates)
- ✅ **Consistency**: Inventory always matches transaction records
- ✅ **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- ✅ **Real-time**: Changes are immediate and visible instantly

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Inventory Errors
The system now throws clear error messages when inventory is insufficient:

```typescript
throw new Error(`Insufficient inventory: Only ${availableCount} ${cylinderType} cylinders available, but ${requestedCount} requested`);

throw new Error(`Insufficient stove inventory: Only ${availableCount} ${quality}-quality stoves available, but ${requestedCount} requested`);

throw new Error(`Insufficient regulator inventory: Only ${availableCount} regulators available, but ${requestedCount} requested`);
```

These errors are:
- ✅ Caught by the frontend
- ✅ Displayed to the user as clear error messages
- ✅ Prevent transaction from completing
- ✅ No inventory is deducted if any item is insufficient

### Warning Messages
For items not found in inventory, the system logs warnings without failing:
```typescript
console.warn(`[B2C] Stove with quality ${quality} not found in inventory`);
console.warn(`[B2C] Product ${itemName} not found in inventory`);
```

## Comparison: B2B vs B2C

| Feature | B2B | B2C |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Cylinder Inventory Deduction | ✅ Yes | ✅ **Now Yes** (Previously ❌) |
| Accessory Inventory Deduction | ✅ Yes | ✅ **Now Yes** (Previously ❌) |
| Return Handling | ✅ Yes | ✅ **Now Yes** (Previously ❌) |
| Real-time Updates | ✅ Yes | ✅ **Now Yes** (Previously ❌) |
| Insufficient Inventory Validation | ✅ Yes | ✅ **Now Yes** (Previously ❌) |
| Stove Quality Handling | ✅ Yes | ✅ **Now Yes** (Previously ❌) |
| Database Transactions | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Already existed) |

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Cylinder Purchase with Security
1. Check current cylinder inventory (e.g., 10 FULL Domestic cylinders)
2. Create B2C transaction with 2 Domestic cylinders + security
3. Verify inventory decreased to 8 FULL cylinders
4. Verify 2 cylinders now show 'WITH_CUSTOMER' status
5. Verify customer's cylinder holdings show 2 cylinders

### Test Case 2: Cylinder Return
1. Customer has 2 cylinders with security deposit
2. Create return transaction for 1 cylinder
3. Verify cylinder status changed to EMPTY
4. Verify location changed to 'Store - Ready for Refill'
5. Verify customer received 75% of security back (25% deduction)
6. Verify cylinder holdings updated

### Test Case 3: Accessory Purchase
1. Check current accessory inventory (e.g., 5 A-quality stoves)
2. Create B2C transaction with 1 Stove - A
3. Verify stove inventory decreased to 4
4. Verify totalCost updated correctly
5. Verify transaction recorded properly

### Test Case 4: Insufficient Inventory
1. Check current inventory (e.g., 1 FULL Standard cylinder)
2. Try to create B2C transaction with 2 Standard cylinders
3. Verify error message shows: "Insufficient inventory: Only 1 STANDARD_15KG cylinders available, but 2 requested"
4. Verify transaction fails and rolls back
5. Verify no inventory was deducted

### Test Case 5: Mixed Transaction
1. Create transaction with:
   - 1 Domestic cylinder + security
   - 1 Stove - B quality
   - 2 Regulators
2. Verify all items deducted from inventory
3. Verify transaction profit calculated correctly
4. Verify cylinder tracking updated

## Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging with `[B2C]` prefix:

```
[B2C] Deducted 2 DOMESTIC_11_8KG cylinders from inventory
[B2C] Returned 1 STANDARD_15KG cylinders to inventory as EMPTY
[B2C] Deducted 1 A-quality stoves from inventory
[B2C] Deducted 2 regulators from inventory
[B2C] Deducted 3 gas pipes from inventory
```

This helps distinguish B2C operations from B2B operations in logs.

## Status

### ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

1. **B2C Cylinder Inventory Deduction** - When security is paid
2. **B2C Cylinder Return Handling** - When cylinders are returned
3. **B2C Accessory Inventory Deduction** - All accessory types
4. **Real-time Inventory Updates** - Within database transactions
5. **Insufficient Inventory Validation** - Clear error messages
6. **Stove Quality Matching** - Extracts and matches quality levels
7. **Multiple Accessory Types** - Stoves, regulators, gas pipes, products
8. **Comprehensive Logging** - All operations logged with [B2C] prefix

### ✅ B2B ALREADY WORKING

- Accessory inventory integration
- Return handling
- Real-time updates

## Conclusion

**B2C customer transactions are now fully integrated with the inventory system**, matching the functionality already present for B2B customers. All transactions happen in real-time within database transactions, ensuring data consistency and immediate inventory updates.

The implementation handles:
- ✅ Cylinder purchases and returns
- ✅ Security deposit tracking
- ✅ Accessory purchases (stoves, regulators, gas pipes, other products)
- ✅ Insufficient inventory validation
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Error handling and logging

Both B2B and B2C customers now have identical inventory integration capabilities.
