## 📊 Example Transaction

| Item | Selling Price | Cost Price | Profit |
|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Gas (11.8kg) | Rs 3,600 | Rs 3,000 | **Rs 600** |
| Regulator | Rs 1,200 | Rs 900 | **Rs 300** |
| Delivery | Rs 500 | Rs 300 | **Rs 200** |
| **TOTAL** | **Rs 5,300** | **Rs 4,200** | **Rs 1,100** ✅ |

**Security Deposit**: Rs 30,000 ❌ NOT counted (refundable!)

**Customer Pays**: Rs 35,300 (gas + regulator + security + delivery)
**Your Profit**: Rs 1,100 (NOT Rs 5,300!)
