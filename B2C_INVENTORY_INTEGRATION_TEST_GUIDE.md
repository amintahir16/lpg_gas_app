# B2C Inventory Integration - Quick Test Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**B2C customer transactions are now fully integrated with inventory!**

### Before:
- ❌ B2C cylinder purchases didn't deduct from inventory
- ❌ B2C accessory purchases didn't deduct from inventory
- ❌ Inventory counts stayed the same regardless of B2C transactions

### After:
- ✅ B2C cylinder purchases deduct from cylinder inventory (real-time)
- ✅ B2C accessory purchases deduct from accessory inventory (real-time)
- ✅ Cylinder returns add back to inventory as EMPTY status
- ✅ Insufficient inventory validation prevents overselling
- ✅ All updates happen atomically within database transactions
