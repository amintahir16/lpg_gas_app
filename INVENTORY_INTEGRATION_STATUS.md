## 💾 Database Transactions

All operations use Prisma transactions:

```typescript
const transaction = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Create transaction record
  // 2. Create transaction items
  // 3. Update customer data
  // 4. Update cylinder inventory
  // 5. Update accessory inventory
  // 6. Update profit tracking
  
  // If ANY step fails, ALL steps rollback
  return newTransaction;
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Atomicity (all or nothing)
- ✅ Consistency (always valid state)
- ✅ Isolation (concurrent transactions safe)
- ✅ Durability (changes persist)
