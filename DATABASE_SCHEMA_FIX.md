# Database Schema Fix - B2C Customer Tables Missing

## 🐛 Problem Identified

After reverting to commit `d2b86b3` ("b2b form checks validation"), the application was failing with:

```
Error [PrismaClientKnownRequestError]: 
The table `public.b2c_customers` does not exist in the current database.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

1. **Git Revert**: When we reverted to the earlier commit, we lost the B2C customer database migrations
2. **Schema Mismatch**: The current database only has B2B customer tables, but the code was trying to access B2C customer tables
3. **Missing Migrations**: The current migrations only include:
   - `20250921194953_b2b_customer_system`
   - `20250922225555_increase_decimal_precision`

## ✅ Fix Applied

### **Modified Combined Customers API** (`src/app/api/customers/combined/route.ts`)

**Before (Failing):**
```typescript
// Fetch B2C customers
const [b2cCustomers, b2cTotal] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.b2CCustomer.findMany({...}),  // ❌ Table doesn't exist
  prisma.b2CCustomer.count({...})      // ❌ Table doesn't exist
]);
```

**After (Working):**
```typescript
// B2C customers temporarily disabled - no B2C tables in current schema
const b2cCustomers: any[] = [];
const b2cTotal = 0;
```

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ **B2B Customers**: Fully functional
- ✅ **Combined API**: Now works with B2B customers only
- ✅ **Database**: Clean and consistent
- ⚠️ **B2C Customers**: Temporarily disabled (no database tables)

## 🔧 Next Steps (If B2C Support Needed)

To re-enable B2C customer support, you would need to:

1. **Add B2C Models to Schema**: Add `B2CCustomer`, `B2CTransaction`, etc. to `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **Create Migration**: Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_b2c_customers`
3. **Update API**: Uncomment the B2C customer code in the combined API

## 📋 Files Modified

- `src/app/api/customers/combined/route.ts` - Disabled B2C customer queries

The application should now work correctly with B2B customers only, matching the current database schema.
